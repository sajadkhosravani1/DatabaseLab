# Database lab
In this repository I'm going to Share Database lab experiments with you.

Note:
- The DBMS I used is **MySQL (Version 8.0)**. 
- The Operating system I used is **Linux** and I use **bash** commands to progress the experiences.

## Install and use MySQL in bash
Use [this page](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-18-04).

## experiences
- [experience 1](./exp1): 
Creating tables.
- [experience 2](./exp2): 
In this experiment we are going to change tables structure in order to:
- Set a specific set of columns as a table `primary key`.
- Set one or more set of columns `uniq`.
- Determine `default` value for columns.
- [experience 3](./exp3): 
In this experiment we are going to change tables structure in order to:
- Reference some column to another column in another table as `foreign key`. 
- Add `check` constraint to some column so that the column
 only accept values that have some specific conditions. 
- [experience 4](./exp4): 
In this experiment we are going to retrieve preferred data from our database.
